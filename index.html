        <p id="bio">Usain Bolt, in full Usain St. Leo Bolt, (born August 21, 1986, Montego Bay, Jamaica), Jamaican sprinter who won gold medals in the 100-metre and 200-metre races in an unprecedented three straight Olympic Games and is widely considered the greatest sprinter of all time.

            Bolt, the son of grocers in Jamaica’s rural Trelawny parish, 
            excelled as a cricket fast bowler in his preteen years. 
            He developed a deep affection for the European football (soccer) 
            teams Real Madrid and Manchester United, but his school coaches 
            steered him toward track and field. Bolt first marked himself 
            as a track prodigy at the 2002 world junior championships. 
            In that meet, racing before a crowd of 36,000 in Jamaica’s 
            National Stadium in Kingston, Bolt—just 15 years old at the 
            time—won gold in the 200 metres, becoming the youngest-ever male 
            world junior champion in any event. At age 16 Bolt cut the junior 
            (age 19 and under) 200-metre world record to 20.13 sec, and at 17 he 
            ran the event in 19.93 sec, becoming the first teenager to break 20 seconds in the race. However, hampered by a hamstring injury, he failed to advance beyond the 200-metre heats at the 2004 Olympics in Athens and placed last in the 2005 world track-and-field championships final.
            At 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 metres), Bolt defied the conventional wisdom 
            that very tall sprinters are disadvantaged as fast starters. In 2007 he 
            appeared newly dedicated to his training and earned a silver medal in 
            the 200 metres at the world championships. He also persuaded his coach to 
            let him try the 100 metres, and he ran 10.03 sec in his first professional 
            race at the distance. On May 3, 2008, he lowered his best time to 9.76 sec, 
            then the world’s second fastest mark. Four weeks later in New York City, Bolt 
            broke the world record, running 9.72 sec to defeat world champion Tyson Gay.
            At the 2008 Olympic Games, Bolt became the first man since American Carl Lewis 
            in 1984 to win the 100 metres, 200 metres, 
            and 4 × 100-metre relay in a single Olympics and the first ever to set 
            world records (9.69 sec, 19.30 sec, and 37.10 sec, respectively) in all 
            three events. (However, a failed drug test by one of his 4 × 100 teammates 
            led to Bolt’s having his gold medal in that event stripped.) His 0.66-sec 
            winning margin in the 200-metre race was the largest in Olympic history, 
            and his 0.20-sec edge over the second-place finisher in the 100 metres, 
            despite beginning his victory celebration about 80 metres into the race, 
            was the largest since Lewis won by the same margin. At the 2009 world 
            championships, Bolt shattered his 100-metre record, winning the event final 
            in 9.58 sec. Four days later he broke his own 200-metre record by the 
            same 0.11-sec margin to win a second gold medal at the world championships.
            Bolt published a memoir, My Story: 9:58: The World’s Fastest Man (written with Shaun Custis), 
            in 2010. It was expanded and reissued as The Fastest Man Alive: 
            The True Story of Usain Bolt in 2012.
